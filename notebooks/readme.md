# Analyses for the paper "Global prevalence of setting longlines at dawn highlights bycatch risk for threatened albatross".

This folder contains notebooks that include the analyses and figures for the paper. Jupytext is required to run these notebooks.


**Brazil_analysis-v20220718.py**: This notebook investigates how sets predicted by the model match with sets recorded in logbooks.

**CompareRFMOhooks2GFWSets.py**: This notebook produces the ratio of hooks to sets mentioned in the Results section of the paper.

**Fig1andAreaAnalysis.py**: This notebook produces Figure 1 from the paper, provides an estimate for how much of the ocean is within 30km of a set in a given time frame, and the fraction of sets entirely at night.

**Fig2andSetsAnalysis.py**: This notebook produces Figure 2 from the paper, number of vessels, number of sets, and set durations.

**Fig3.py**: This notebook produces Figure 3.

**Fig4.py**: This notebook produces Figure 4, which shows the extent to which albatross ranges overlap with longline sets.

**longline_test_evaluation_v20220802.py**: This notebook produces the precision and recall for the model.

**night_setting_percentage_analysis.py**: This notebook produces the night setting percentages for Table 1.

**Make_longline_tables-v20220802.py**: This notebook produces the bigquery tables for the night ratio analysis.
